GOC Ticket Exchanger (GOCTX)
============================

About
-----

Java application to exchange(synchronize) tickets to and from various ticketing systems (Footprints, GGUS, RT, ServiceNow, and others)

GOC-TX wait for "trigger" which is an email containing ticket exchange ID, and ticket ID sent by various ticketing system, and initiate creation / synchronization between source / destination ticketing systems.

GOC-TX requires following components

1) A linux sever to run GOC-TX
2) A mail server that can forward email to GOC-TX (such as /etc/aliaes for postfix)
3) MySQL DB for GOC-TX.

You will also need to be able to write a few Java classes which will handle various "corner" cases if you want GOC-TX to do something intelligent.

Installation Detail
-------------------

Installation instructions are for CentOS 6.3. Other distributions may vary.

- Install mysql-server, git, java 1.6:

`# yum install -y mysql-server git java-1.6.0-openjdk`

- Clone the git repo. Build, install:

`# git clone git://github.com/soichih/goctx.git`
`# cd goctx`
`# git checkout mpackard`
`# ant install`

That will install in /opt/goctx

(To install in a different location, run: 'ant -Dinstall.dir=/some/other/directory install'.)

We use Postfix for mail service. Configure it to allow for sending and receiving mail. Also your firewall should allow both incoming and outgoing mail to this server.

- Checkout GOC-TX source:

`# git clone https://github.com/soichih/goctx`

- Create GOC-TX database & user, grant rights (use a different password):

`# mysqladmin -p create goctx`
`# mysql> create user 'goctx'@'localhost' identified by '12345abcdeâ€™;`
`# mysql> grant all privileges on goctx.* to goctx@localhost;`

- Import GOC-TX tables using included sql file:

`# mysql -u goctx -p goctx < mysql.sql`

- Configure Postfix for address extension. Put something like this in /etc/postfix/main.cf:

`recipient_delimiter = +`

- Create an alias for the GOC-TX account to receive mail. Add this to /etc/aliases:

`goctx: |/opt/goctx/bin/run_goctx.sh`

Then run:

`# newaliases`

- Open firewall ports between the GOCTX server & all the ticket systems it will need to access.

- Generate jssecacerts file & add all the servers GOCTX will need to access. 

`# cd /usr/local/goctx/etc`
`# java -cp build goctx.InstallCert tickets.site1.example.com`
`# java -cp build goctx.InstallCert tickets.site2.example.com`

- Populate your goctx.properties file to include the sites you want to use. See goctx.properties.example for details.

`# vi /opt/goctx/etc/goctx.properties`
